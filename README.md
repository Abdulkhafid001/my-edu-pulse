this is me building a learning management system to help teachers/mentors/trainers get to a larger audience with lessons. Basically, an school.
the features this saas platform offers are to enable a school-like feel to students/persons learning stuff online. it would permit users to sign up as teachers or students or even admins and give live reporting analytics to the user.
